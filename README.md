# Presentary

Open source slides and presentations!

## About

We had enough of your fancy closed source presentations, let's make them open source!

## Technical stuff

We're using [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) to back up our JS. Schema for the slides is currently
available inside `slides.json`, which is loaded initially. After that, each slide is loaded from its
path and converted from Markdown to HTML.

## Getting started

```
npm install
node bin/server
```
